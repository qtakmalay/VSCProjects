#
# Task 1
#

# Write a function that converts a color image, represented as numpy array of
# shape (H, W, 3) into a grayscale image, represented as numpy array of shape
# (H, W). The color channels are in order RGB. The numpy array is of type
# np.uint8 with values from 0 to 255. The function should take 4 arguments: the
# numpy array representing the image and the 3 contributions of the red, green
# and blue channel (in this order). Default values for contributions of the red,
# green and blue channel should be r=0.2989, g=0.5870, b=0.1140 (this is just
# one way, check the link
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale#Converting_colour_to_grayscale
# for different ways of conversion). The function should return a numpy array of
# type np.uint8.
example_image = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(50, 40, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

#
# Task 2
#

# Find out programmatically which image folder belongs to the cluster as seen in
# the visualization of the RGB means and standard deviations of the main script.
# Hint: We know the cluster is somewhere around mean=[140, 150, 150] and
# std=[35, 40, 50] for channels R, G and B. We can use this to compute a
# distance from these three (mean, std) points to our data points. We can then
# sort the data points by that distance and locate the points close to these
# three points. If a lot of images from one folder are close, we have found our
# culprit! You can use np.argsort() to get data point indices sorted by distance
# and np.unique(..., return_counts=True) to get how often individual elements
# occur in an array.
