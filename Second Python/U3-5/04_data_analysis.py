# Our dataset
################################################################################

# Our dataset consists of RGB(A) images stored as .jpg files. The files are
# organized in folders, each folder representing an individual data collection
# process (not really, but for demonstration purposes, assume this is the case).
# The images are part of the following two datasets:
# 1) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pollen-grain-image-classification
# 2) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification
# A subset of both datasets was selected to compose our image dataset of 10
# folders, each with 100 images, i.e., 1000 images in total.

# Path to the dataset (unzip the "04_images.zip" archive)
input_path = "04_images"

#
# Let's start by taking a look at our data by reading in one file
#

# We are dealing with image data, so each sample is high-dimensional and
# contains as many features as it has pixels. Pixel values range from 0 to 255
# in 3 color channels for RGB and in 1 channel for grayscale images. In case
# transparency is also stored, we have an additional channel (alpha).

#
# Check means and standard deviations of images
#

# We know how many images to expect, so we can already allocate numpy arrays to
# store mean and std values as float values and the folder_names of the folders.
# Since we want RGB images, we will collect the metrics for each channel,
# dropping the transparency information in case an image has an alpha channel.

# Downprojection and visualization of our data

# We want to check for clusters in our data. We want to use, e.g., t-SNE, but

# pretrained CNN to downproject the images into a better suited feature space
# before we apply t-SNE.

#
# Projecting our images to a CNN feature space
#

# PyTorch gives us convenient access to datasets and pretrained models via
# torchvision. The original models and data might not be hosted by PyTorch
# itself, so they might change, and we thus should always keep a local copy if
# we want reproducibility.

# We want some model that has few features before its output layer and was
# trained on targets that are related to our task.

# forward our image data to the pretrained model (what exactly must be done here
# depends on how the model was originally trained; luckily, the .transforms()
# method here can be used to obtain all the required transformations)

        # we need yet another dimension: (N, 3, H, W), where N is the number of
        # samples. In our case, N=1, i.e., we can simply add a new dimension
        # (either via slicing syntax or torch.unsqueeze())

# Inspecting the downprojected images

# t-SNE is good for visualization, but we cannot blindly trust the results. To
# inspect our clusters and check what they mean/if they make sense, we have to
# take a look at the clustered images. This can give you important information
# about the properties of your dataset.
