# In realistic scenarios, our dataset class might look a lot more complex. Not

# be much more sophisticated than just indexing. For example, let's create a
# dataset class that creates a simulated dataset of 10^15 random samples. Each
# sample is a sequence, described by a 2D array of input features of shape
# (sequence_length, n_features), with random values in the range [-1, 1). Each
# sample belongs to either a positive or negative class. In positive-class
# samples, we will implant the pattern [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1] in feature 0 at the
# beginning of the sequences. Since 10^15 is a large number, we do not want to
# hold that dataset in RAM. Instead, we create the random samples on-the-fly.

# PyTorch data handling - Minibatch stacking via "collate_fn"
################################################################################

# By default, the PyTorch DataLoader class will convert the sample arrays to
# tensors and stack them by introducing a new first dimension.
# In some cases, stacking arrays to minibatches will not work that easily. For
# example, if you want to stack samples with different shapes, such as sequences
# of variable length or images of variable width/height.
# In other cases, you may want to perform stacking to a minibatch in a very
# memory-efficient way, e.g., pre-allocating arrays for one-hot features.
# We can implement our own stacking function by passing the argument
# "collate_fn" to our dataloader, which should be our custom stacking function.
# https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html
# https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#dataloader-collate-fn

#
# Simple example: No stacking of minibatch
#

# Function to be passed to torch.utils.data.DataLoader as "collate_fn". It will
# receive one argument: A list of the samples in the minibatch, as they were
# returned by the __getitem__ method of a PyTorch Dataset. Keep in mind that
# each sample is represented by a tuple, containing, e.g., the features, labels
# and IDs (see example above). In this example, instead of stacking the samples
# and converting them to tensors, the samples will be individually converted to
# tensors and packed into a list instead.
def no_stack_collate_fn(batch_as_list: list):
    # Number of entries per sample-tuple (e.g., 3 for features, labels, IDs)
    n_entries_per_sample = len(batch_as_list[0])
    # Go through all entries in all samples of the given list batch, convert
    # these entries to tensors and put them in lists
    list_batch = [[torch.tensor(sample[entry_i]) for sample in batch_as_list]
                  for entry_i in range(n_entries_per_sample)]
    # Return the minibatch
    return list_batch


# Let's try our "collate_fn" on our sequence dataset:
training_loader = DataLoader(training_set, shuffle=False, batch_size=4, collate_fn=no_stack_collate_fn)

for i, data in enumerate(training_loader):
    # Our minibatch is now a list of tensors instead of one stacked tensor!
    mb_sample_features, mb_sample_labels, mb_sample_ids = data
    print(f"Loaded samples {mb_sample_ids}, labels {mb_sample_labels}")
    if i > 5:
        break


#
# Example: Stacking and conversion of numpy arrays only
#

# Let's assume we want to return a sample tuple that consists of (features,
# labels, ID) but ID cannot be converted to a tensor (e.g., because it is a
# string).

# As example, we can inherit from our RandomSeqDataset class and overwrite the
# __getitem__ method such that the sample ID is a string:
class NewRandomSeqDataset(RandomSeqDataset):
    
    def __getitem__(self, index):
        # Call original __getitem__ from RandomSeqDataset class
        original_sample = super().__getitem__(index)
        sample_features, sample_class_label, sample_id = original_sample
        # Return the sample entries but convert sample_id to string
        return sample_features, sample_class_label, str(sample_id)


# Since strings cannot be converted to tensors or stacked, we have to stack and
# convert the sample entries only if they are stackable and convertible to
# tensors. We start by building the logic of converting-and-stacking-if-possible
# by implementing a function that will attempt to stack "something_to_stack" and
# convert it to a tensor. If not possible, "something_to_stack" will be returned
# as it was.
def stack_or_not(something_to_stack: list):
    try:
        # Convert to tensors (TypeError if it fails)
        tensor_list = [torch.tensor(s) for s in something_to_stack]
        # Try to stack tensors (RuntimeError if it fails)
        stacked_tensors = torch.stack(tensor_list, dim=0)
        return stacked_tensors
    except (TypeError, RuntimeError):
        return something_to_stack


# And now, we use it in our custom collate_fn, which will stack samples to a
# minibatch if possible
def stack_if_possible_collate_fn(batch_as_list: list):
    # Number of entries per sample-tuple (e.g., 3 for features, labels, IDs)
    n_entries_per_sample = len(batch_as_list[0])
    # Go through all entries in all samples and apply our "stack_or_not"
    list_batch = [stack_or_not([sample[entry_i] for sample in batch_as_list])
                  for entry_i in range(n_entries_per_sample)]
    # Return the minibatch (contains either stacked tensors, or lists of
    # elements that could not be converted to tensors)
    return list_batch


# We create a dataset instance of our new NewRandomSeqDataset
training_set = NewRandomSeqDataset(sequence_length=16, n_features=9)
# And load it via the PyTorch dataloader with our "stack_if_possible_collate_fn"
training_loader = DataLoader(training_set, shuffle=False, batch_size=4, collate_fn=stack_if_possible_collate_fn)

for i, data in enumerate(training_loader):
    # Our minibatch is now a stacked tensor where possible and a list otherwise!
    mb_sample_features, mb_sample_labels, mb_sample_ids = data

# Setting global random seeds via, e.g., np.random.seed(0) will not make the
# order of samples or randomness in __getitem__ deterministic if the DataLoader
# is using multiple workers. Work-around for __getitem__ randomness: You can
# create a random generator object in __getitem__ which is using the sample
# index as random seed to always get the same random behavior for samples with
# the same index.
#
# Note: Pre-allocating memory is faster than first creating small arrays and
# then stacking them (unless PyTorch can optimize it using its magic).
#
# Using too many multiple worker processes will result in additional system
# overhead (managing the processes) and slow your program down! Always check
# the CPU utilization!
#
# It's good practice to save the indices of dataset splits in dedicated files.
