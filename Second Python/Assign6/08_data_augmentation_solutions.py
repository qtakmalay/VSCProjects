# Task 1
#

# To make dropout on image data more effective, we can also drop out blocks of
# pixels that are adjacent in the spatial and channel dimensions (see DropBlock
# https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12890) or replace them with random values (see
# Random Erasing https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04896). Your task is to create a
# DropBlock PyTorch module that processes an input tensor with an expected shape
# of (..., H, W), where "..." can be arbitrary many leading dimensions.
