# Task 1
#

# Implement gradient descent using the gradients computed via "backward()"
# without using the PyTorch optimizer. The goal is to get the loss below 0.1 by
# optimizing the trainable weight tensor "weights". The loss should be computed
# from the output and the target "target_tensor". The output calculation should
# be done using
#   output = input_tensor.matmul(weights)
# and the loss should be the mean-squared error
#   loss = ((target_tensor - output) ** 2).mean()
# The "input_tensor" and "target_tensor" can be obtained by iterating over the
# "sample_generator()" generator:
#   for update, (input_tensor, target_tensor) in enumerate(sample_generator()):
#       CODE
#
# Hint: For gradient descent, you will need to compute the gradients of the loss
# w.r.t. the trainable weight tensor. You then multiply the negative gradients
# with a learning rate that is in range [0, 1], which gives you the update you
# have to apply to the trainable weight tensor. Adding the update to the
# trainable weight tensor is one update step. This update however, should NOT be
# recorded by autograd, so you will have to disable the gradient calculation
# when performing the update step. This can be done with the "torch.no_grad()"
# context manager. Lastly, do not forget to zero the gradients after calling
# "backward()". More information on gradient descent (and a nice analogy for
# understanding): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent

# Task 3
#

# Given 2D samples "data" and their corresponding class labels "targets", create
# a PyTorch Dataset and a DataLoader, and then train a model of your choice.
# Afterward, get the model's predictions for the same data. Create a plot that
# shows the loss values collected during training, a scatter plot of the data
# colored according to the ground truth ("targets") and a scatter plot of the
# data colored according to the model's predictions. Also, include the accuracy
# in this last plot. All hyperparameters (optimizer, learning rate, batch size,
# number of epochs, etc.) are up to you.
#
# Hint: Choose a fitting loss function (classification task). For getting the
# predictions, you need to inspect the output of your model and select the one
# with the highest value (intuition: the model output are probabilities for each
# class). The index of this highest value entry is then the predicted class (you
# can use the tensor method "argmax" to obtain this index). The accuracy is
# defined as the fraction of correct predictions, i.e., you count how often the
# model's predicted class is equal to the true target class, and then you divide
# by the total number of samples.
